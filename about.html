        This webpage is a way to add landscape card-shaped things to physical Dominion games. They are not sorted by Expansion, but by Type (Event, Landmark, etc.) and what Components (Victory Tokens, Debt etc.) are needed.<br>
        Select which Components you own (or are willing to use makeshift versions of). By default all tokens are selected, but not cards.<br>
        Select which Landscape types you want, the minimum and maximum you want chosen.<br>
        Select how many Landscapes you want in total. By default this is 2, the maximum reccommended amount.<br>
<br>
        There is also a generator for Way of the Mouse, Riverboat, and Approaching Army, which allow you to choose which expansions the $2-$3 / $5 / Attack cards come from.<br>
        The expansions are shown by their symbols and listed in order of original release, with Promo cards at the end.<br>
        If its a Liaison or Omen, an Ally/Prophesy can be added, and if it's a Fate/Doom card, a generator for Boons/Hexes will be displayed.
