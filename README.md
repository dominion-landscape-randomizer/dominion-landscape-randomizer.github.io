# dominion-landscape-randomizer

This webpage is a way to add landscape card-shaped things to physical Dominion games. They are not sorted by Expansion, but by Type (Event, Landmark, etc.) and what Components (Victory Tokens, Debt etc.) are needed.
It randomly selects a specified number of landscape cards based on selected parameters. 

To use:
- Select which Components you own (or are willing to use makeshift versions of). By default all tokens are selected, but not cards.
- Select which Landscape types you want, the minimum and maximum you want chosen.
- Select how many Landscapes you want in total. By default this is 2, the maximum reccommended amount.

There is also a generator for Way of the Mouse, which allows you to choose which expansions the $2/$3 cost cards come from.
The expansions are shown by their symbols and listed in order of original release, with Promo cards at the end.
If it's a Liaison, an Ally will be added, and if it's a Fate card, a generator for Boons will be displayed.
